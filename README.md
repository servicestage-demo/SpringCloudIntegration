# THIS IS UNMAINTAINED

As Eureka is no longer NMAINTAINED, we decide to develop a new solution https://github.com/huaweicloud/spring-cloud-huawei to bring more valuable feature for users of servicecomb and huawei cloud.

Moving forward I would suggest you use spring cloud huawei for those reasons:


- service mesh solution
- high perfomance API gateway
- route management, canary release
- work both on cloud and on-premise platform(compatiobel with both huawei cloud and ServiceComb)
